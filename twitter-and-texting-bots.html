  <p>Last January 24-25 I joined my first ever hackathon. I built a twitter bot and suddenly bots, AI and NLP were so interesting. The twitter bot I built was simple, it replies to mentions and the reply contained links to what it thinks is relevant based on the wiki back end. Think of it as a proactive google if people used twitter like google.</p>

<p>And people are starting to use their social networks like search engines. I used to see some memes about people mistakenly updating status on FB as if typing search queries on google. It then became normal behavior after some time. People now call this crowdsouring on the social graph.</p>
<p>Companies on the otherhand have used twitter for customer service. Instead of hiring more people to answer queries as some companies do, twitter bots can handle the job better and answer faster automatically.</p>
<p>From another angle, we have Siri, Google Now and Cortana. We use speech to talk to our phones and make it do something. Speech is transcribed to text and we have our bot understand the text and act on it, giving back a reply. We can say the big tech companies have been working on it for some time now because speech to text is a difficult problem.</p>
<p>There will be a time when we'll be talking to our phones to send commands to bots that do our bidding. We'll be interacting with bots in different ways and we'll get instant feedback from expert knowledge, unlike the "incomplete" knowledge we receive from our social circles. I like that future.</p>
<p>So I'm now studying Natural Language Processing concepts based python modules like nltk. There's so much out there I don't know and the net is much more than just for creating web apps. It's so exciting! :P</p>
