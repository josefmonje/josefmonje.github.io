  <p>Welcome to my redesigned blog!</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">Pelican</a> as my CMS/static site generator, <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> for hosting (yes, you could do that!) and a little <a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular.js</a> to make it look somewhat dynamic. Maybe I'll add some more animations too. For the styling, I used <a href="http://purecss.io/">Pure.css</a> as base.</p>
<p>I hope to spend more time blogging to help me reflect on my code and show off some practice projects. I'll also blog about some of my other activities and the things I buy online. Hopefully I'll be blogging more about productive stuff rather than personal stuff. Let's see how it goes this time around.</p>
<p>For those who recognize it, the inspiration for this blog's design is the NES console. Love that machine! Lots of childhood hours well spent in front of the TV. <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-up"></i></p>
