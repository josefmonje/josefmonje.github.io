I built a twitter bot and suddenly bots, AI and NLP were so interesting. The twitter bot I built was simple, it replies to mentions and the reply contained links to what it thinks is relevant based on the wiki back end. Think of it as a proactive google if people used twitter like google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/563729030445539328&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And people are starting to use their social networks like search engines. I used to see some memes about people mistakenly updating status on FB as if typing search queries on google. It then became normal behavior after some time. People now call this crowdsouring on the social graph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies on the otherhand have used twitter for customer service. Instead of hiring more people to answer queries as some companies do, twitter bots can handle the job better and answer faster automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From another angle, we have Apple's Siri, Google Now, Microsoft's Cortana and the Amazon Echo. We use speech to talk to our phones and make it do something. Speech is transcribed to text and we have our bot understand the text and act on it, giving back a reply. We can say the big tech companies have been working on it for some time now because speech to text is a difficult problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be a time when we'll be talking to our phones to send commands to bots that do our bidding. We'll be interacting with bots in different ways and we'll get instant feedback from expert knowledge, unlike the "incomplete" knowledge we receive from our social circles. I like that future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I'm now studying Natural Language Processing concepts based python modules like nltk. There's so much out there I don't know and the net is much more than just for creating web apps. It's so exciting! :P&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="python"></category><category term="tornado"></category><category term="bots"></category><category term="AI"></category><category term="NLP"></category><category term="twitter"></category><category term="SMS"></category></entry><entry><title>Web Development in Python</title><link href="https://josefmonje.com/web-development-in-python.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-12-31T11:11:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Josef Monje</name></author><id>tag:josefmonje.com,2014-12-31:web-development-in-python.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last post was about a JavaScript framework. This month it's about Python and the various frameworks I've used. It'll be nice to reflect on these posts next year to benchmark my skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use python when working on server-side code and I've tried several python web development frameworks. As an aside, for me the beauty of python is its readability. Python has powerful features and all, but one of the things I consider important when coding is that I am coding for others. It may be literally so when working on open source projects but it's also benificial for yourself. Imagine when reading old code, debugging and understanding how the code works! Comments would be minimal and less people asking when looking at your code ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first framework I learned was &lt;a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/"&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt;. It's a joy to work with on small projects and you can just integrate what's out there when you need it. If you're building something really small or need something really quick, I'd recommend Flask. Learning Flask is so easy, I did it in just an afternoon. You can quickly create stuff with it and see the results. I learn faster when the time between acquiring new knowledge and seeing results from building with it is shorter so starting with Flask was good for me. If you're new to python but not to web development, I would recommend going straight to studying Django.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also tried &lt;a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/"&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; for a project just for fun. I learned about it during a meetup so I tried it out and made it work right away. I was able to use it for a small project. It's not very far from Flask but I like Tornado because it's async. I won't get into that but async seems like the way to go for projects intended for large audiences while minimizing required resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not the least is &lt;a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;. Django has quite a steep learning curve but like what they say about it, the framework has "batteries included". There's a tutorial on the Django website and it's a few pages long. You can see there's quite a lot of things to learn to effectively django but among the frameworks I've tried, this is probably the best for medium to large projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django code is organized into app modules and within those, the views (controllers, actually, so don't get confused by the label) are in their own files, models in one, admin in another, etc. You get the idea. This is something enforced in Django so it takes a while to get used to if the idea is new to you. After getting used to it, I find that it's a good idea to take with you when working on other frameworks, like the ones I previously mentioned. It just makes sense to but you don't have to take it to the extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django comes with a 'free' admin module for looking at your models and doing some basic CRUD. This saves a lot of development time if you have to do it yourself. It tightly integrates with the also built-in authentication module and ORM. This has a lot of advantages to it and some downsides. It you plan on using a database that's not supported by the ORM, you won't be taking advantage of the provided authentication and admin modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things I consider when selecting a framework is the size of the project. If it's a small project or a prototype, Flask would do and I'm probably going to use Angular with it as well as a NoSQL database. Otherwise it's almost always Django.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="python"></category><category term="flask"></category><category term="tornado"></category><category term="django"></category></entry><entry><title>Famo.us</title><link href="https://josefmonje.com/famous.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-11-24T11:30:53+08:00</updated><author><name>Josef Monje</name></author><id>tag:josefmonje.com,2014-11-24:famous.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This month's post is about the &lt;a href="https://famo.us/"&gt;Famo.us&lt;/a&gt; framework. I'm going to dedicate a lot of time to &lt;a href="http://famo.us/university/home/#/"&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt; this javascript framework because I think it's cool in a few ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Famo.us lets developers create smooth complex animations in the browser using its rendering and physics engine. Animations flow as if they were native code on mobile apps, except they're in the browser. Normally, browsers would have a hard time doing this because of the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing I really like about it is the integration with &lt;a href="http://angularjs.org"&gt;Angular.js&lt;/a&gt;. I really like Angular because of how you can make some complex things really easily, with minimal code. The learning curve for both frameworks are steep but I'm quite comfortable with Angular now so it's just a matter of time before I can be as confident with Famo.us (I hope!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, I also put up &lt;strong&gt;Famo.us in Manila &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/824687484220358/"&gt;FB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/Famo-us-in-Manila-Meetup-Group/"&gt;Meetup&lt;/a&gt; groups&lt;/strong&gt; to bring together people who are curious or want to learn more about Famo.us. I don't think this will be a large group so that'll be better for people who want to get more involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, the &lt;a href="https://josefmonje.com"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; is now on SSL!

Aside from all the tech related things in my life, this is one other thing that I spend my time on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inducted to JCI San Juan Pinaglabanan in 2006/7, couldn't remember, (but it's on my plaque upstairs) and was only partially active/completely inactive for a long time. When I had the chance to connect with the Jaycees from my province I decided to be active again, just as a participant. I was reluctant at first but I was appointed as an officer. This year I'm the Executive Vice President for JCI Cabanatuan Golden Grain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JCI Cabanatuan, as a chapter, is experiencing a revival. These past few months, many are becoming part of the active core group. This is partly because of our experience in hosting the Area Conference for Area One this year. I'm hopeful 2015 will be a good year for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have quite a few friends from my various networks who are also Jaycees from other chapters. It feels good to reconnect with some of them. I look forward to meeting old and new friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel that this is already too long for a post. I'm not into talking about myself nor reading long posts so I won't put much of that in my blog. I'll leave you with the JCI Creed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We believe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That faith in god gives meaning and purpose to human life,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That the brotherhood of man transcends the sovereignty of nations,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That economic justice can best be won by free men through free enterprise,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That government should be of laws rather than of men,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That earth's great treasure lies in human personality,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And that service to humanity is the best work of life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; as my CMS/static site generator, &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; for hosting (yes, you could do that!) and a little &lt;a href="http://angularjs.org/"&gt;Angular.js&lt;/a&gt; to make it look somewhat dynamic. Maybe I'll add some more animations too. For the styling, I used &lt;a href="http://purecss.io/"&gt;Pure.css&lt;/a&gt; as base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to spend more time blogging to help me reflect on my code and show off some practice projects. I'll also blog about some of my other activities and the things I buy online. Hopefully I'll be blogging more about productive stuff rather than personal stuff. Let's see how it goes this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who recognize it, the inspiration for this blog's design is the NES console. &lt;i class="fa fa-heart"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; that machine!
