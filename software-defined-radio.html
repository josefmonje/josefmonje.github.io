  <p>It's been almost half a year since my last post! How time really flies. I've been intending to post and more often than once a month but I just haven't developed the habit. That's the bad news.</p>
<p>The good news is I've been busy with a lot of experimentation and some projects! I was recently involved in a hardware project and I can't resist my curiosity. My current favorite thing now is SDR or software-defined radio. It lets my computer interact with radio waves using the right gadgets. How boring is that explanation. But the possibilities are almost endless!</p>
<p>Many things use radio waves to communicate. AM and FM (obviously!), Wi-fi, bluetooth, remote controls of drones and RC's (<strong>Radio controlled</strong>... duh), and even cellphones! More and more things are going to communicate wirelessly in the era of IoT. There are even things that unintentionally emit rf signals and these have been used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_(codename)">interesting ways</a>.</p>
<p>Much interesting very wow. SDR captured me just like that.</p>
<p>I got my hands on a Raspberry Pi 2 model B and with Kali linux SDR on it. Just waiting for some hardware to arrive... then Research time!</p>
