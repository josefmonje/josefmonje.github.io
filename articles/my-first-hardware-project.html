      <p>My involvement with this hardware project was accidental. I went to this workshop and sat beside a person that I ended up chatting with for the rest of the event. He was an electronics person. As it turned out, he had a client and two of his students worked on the project for him and both just left him after two months. He's about to have a presentation. Here's I get pulled into the story.</p>
<p>He asks me to try it out and let me access all their work. I built in a week what they worked on for two months. This is where I got my first experience working with Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, sensors and cameras. The system consists of a thermal sensor, an RFID reader and a camera. It's a security system for monitoring employees. When the sensor detects a person, the reader waits to read a tag. When a tag isn't read, a screenshot will be taken by the camera and sent to a server. The camera also monitors the number of individuals it sees. That's it.</p>
<p>It wasn't hard at all. Everything's fine as long as the hardware was working. In room temperature, it detects the slightest heat, even the passing of warm electricfan air. After more testing, we found that the thermal camera didn't work well with airconditioning. The range severely dropped to mere centimeters. Not good. We looked for other sensors and motion sensors had quite some delays when in operation. They usually had about 2 seconds delay. We settled for a brand that had the least delay, about .3 seconds. Waiting for that part now.</p>
<p>The devices communicate via web so my roots in web development came in handy. Compared to web development projects, I really liked working on this. The hardware part makes it tangible and very fulfilling.</p>
<p>Now I have my own Raspberry Pi, Arduino, SDR, sensors, wireless modules and stuff to continue experimenting but I want to have some direction. To build something that people, or clients will value. I want to work on more hardware projects. I want to focus on just building.</p>
