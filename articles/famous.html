  <p>This month's post is about the <a href="https://famo.us/">Famo.us</a> framework. I'm going to dedicate a lot of time to <a href="http://famo.us/university/home/#/">learn</a> this javascript framework because I think it's cool in a few ways.</p>
<p>Famo.us lets developers create smooth complex animations in the browser using its rendering and physics engine. Animations flow as if they were native code on mobile apps, except they're in the browser. Normally, browsers would have a hard time doing this because of the DOM.</p>
<p>The other thing I really like about it is the integration with <a href="http://angularjs.org">Angular.js</a>. I really like Angular because of how you can make some complex things really easily, with minimal code. The learning curve for both frameworks are steep but I'm quite comfortable with Angular now so it's just a matter of time before I can be as confident with Famo.us (I hope!).</p>
<p>By the way, I also put up <strong>Famo.us in Manila <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/824687484220358/">FB</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Famo-us-in-Manila-Meetup-Group/">Meetup</a> groups</strong> to bring together people who are curious or want to learn more about Famo.us. I don't think this will be a large group so that'll be better for people who want to get more involved.</p>
<p>In other news, the <a href="https://josefmonje.com">site</a> is now on SSL! Yey!</p>
