  <p>Last post was about a JavaScript framework. This month it's about Python and the various frameworks I've used. It'll be nice to reflect on these posts next year to benchmark my skills.</p>
<p>I use python when working on server-side code and I've tried several python web development frameworks. As an aside, for me the beauty of python is its readability. Python has powerful features and all, but one of the things I consider important when coding is that I am coding for others. It may be literally so when working on open source projects but it's also benificial for yourself. Imagine when reading old code, debugging and understanding how the code works! Comments would be minimal and less people asking when looking at your code ;)</p>
<p>The first framework I learned was <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>. It's a joy to work with on small projects and you can just integrate what's out there when you need it. If you're building something really small or need something really quick, I'd recommend Flask. Learning Flask is so easy, I did it in just an afternoon. You can quickly create stuff with it and see the results. I learn faster when the time between acquiring new knowledge and seeing results from building with it is shorter so starting with Flask was good for me. If you're new to python but not to web development, I would recommend going straight to studying Django.</p>
<p>I also tried <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/">Tornado</a> for a project just for fun. I learned about it during a meetup so I tried it out and made it work right away. I was able to use it for a small project. It's not very far from Flask but I like Tornado because it's async. I won't get into that but async seems like the way to go for projects intended for large audiences while minimizing required resources.</p>
<p>Last but not the least is <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. Django has quite a steep learning curve but like what they say about it, the framework has "batteries included". There's a tutorial on the Django website and it's a few pages long. You can see there's quite a lot of things to learn to effectively django but among the frameworks I've tried, this is probably the best for medium to large projects.</p>
<p>Django code is organized into app modules and within those, the views (controllers, actually, so don't get confused by the label) are in their own files, models in one, admin in another, etc. You get the idea. This is something enforced in Django so it takes a while to get used to if the idea is new to you. After getting used to it, I find that it's a good idea to take with you when working on other frameworks, like the ones I previously mentioned. It just makes sense to but you don't have to take it to the extreme.</p>
<p>Django comes with a 'free' admin module for looking at your models and doing some basic CRUD. This saves a lot of development time if you have to do it yourself. It tightly integrates with the also built-in authentication module and ORM. This has a lot of advantages to it and some downsides. It you plan on using a database that's not supported by the ORM, you won't be taking advantage of the provided authentication and admin modules.</p>
<p>One of the things I consider when selecting a framework is the size of the project. If it's a small project or a prototype, Flask would do and I'm probably going to use Angular with it as well as a NoSQL database. Otherwise it's almost always Django.</p>
