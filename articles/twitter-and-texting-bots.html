<h2>I joined a hackathon</h2>
<p>Last January 24-25 I joined my first ever hackathon. I built a Twitter bot and suddenly bots, AI and NLP were so interesting. The Twitter bot I built was simple, it replies to mentions and the reply contained links to what it thinks is relevant based on the wiki back end. Think of it as a proactive google if people used Twitter like google.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://Twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/563729030445539328">"can someone call my phone -- i cant find it"</a></p>

<h2>People like talking to other people - but they're not as good as machines</h2>
<p>People sometimes use their social networks like search engines. It's now normal to just ask something on Facebook or Twitter and answers come to you. Crowdsource your social graph, it's the easier than sifting through search results.</p>
<p>Companies on the otherhand have used Twitter for customer service. Instead of searching for the right forums or contact form online or the e-mail address of customer service, people just say it out loud on Twitter. Instead of hiring more people to answer queries as some companies do, Twitter bots can handle the job better and answer faster automatically.</p>
<h2>Our gadgets want to understand us</h2>
<p>The search box is basically a command-line interface for the internet. Beefed up with algorithms, it tries to reduce friction by making it less boolean-y or cli-ish, and prone to typos to get that piece of information faster.</p>
<p>We have Apple's Siri, Google Now, Microsoft's Cortana and the Amazon Echo. We use speech to talk to our gadgets and make it do something. Speech is probably transcribed to text and machines react. Big tech companies have been working on speech to text for some time, it's a difficult problem.</p>
<h2>We will socialize with AI</h2>
<p>The way we work in today's Internet of Humans will be different from how we work in tomorrow's Internet of Things. Chat and messaging are back. Yesterday's IRC is now Twitter or Slack. We will have better versions of X, @DearAssistant, and Slackbot. We will expect more from online services in many ways. I can't specify what "more" means but it's within the range of "relating to our humanity". The internet will continue to be "social" but the meaning of social could expand to accommodate human-like interaction with online services.</p>

<p>O'Reilly explores the idea that realtime chat and chatbots will be part of how developers work in their Distributed Development Stack Field Guide.</p>
<p>As gadgets become smaller, the keyboard will have a difficult time squeezing into the interface of a device. What if the device isn't visual or come to a point where you can't have you hands interact with so easily (iWatches, Google Glasses)?</p>
<h2>The future will be filled with bots</h2>
<p><a href="http://continuations.com/post/108271329110/tedxnewyork-big-and-bot-policy-proposals">Albert Wenger</a> of USV proposes the idea of being able to be represented by a bot. Think of it like your personal or your person's proxy to the digital world. It's a profound idea and his video explains it well.</p>
<p>There will be a time when we'll be talking to our gadgets. We will chat or type commands to our bot underlings. It may or may not include voice. Bots will live in our gadgets or in online servers to do our bidding. We may also have personal bots to talk to other bots or online services. Somehow I feel <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> has that potential.</p>
<p>So I'm now studying Natural Language Processing concepts based python modules like nltk. There's so much out there I don't know and the net is much more than just for creating web apps. It's so exciting! :P</p>
<p>The image is from the movie "Her" (2013), a movie I'll soon watch. I don't really watch a lot of movies. But I'll watch this one because it I imagine we will have more of "Her" in the future.</p>
