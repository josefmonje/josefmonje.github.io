      <p>Last week I came back from the JCI Philippines National Convention 2014 at Cagayan De Oro. Aside from all the tech related things in my life, this is one other thing that I spend my time on.</p>
<p>I was inducted to JCI San Juan Pinaglabanan in 2006/7, couldn't remember, (but it's on my plaque upstairs) and was only partially active/completely inactive for a long time. When I had the chance to connect with the Jaycees from my province I decided to be active again, just as a participant. I was reluctant at first but I was appointed as an officer. This year I'm the Executive Vice President for JCI Cabanatuan Golden Grain.</p>
<p>JCI Cabanatuan, as a chapter, is experiencing a revival. These past few months, many are becoming part of the active core group. This is partly because of our experience in hosting the Area Conference for Area One this year. I'm hopeful 2015 will be a good year for us.</p>
<p>I have quite a few friends from my various networks who are also Jaycees from other chapters. It feels good to reconnect with some of them. I look forward to meeting old and new friends.</p>
<p>I feel that this is already too long for a post. I'm not into talking about myself nor reading long posts so I won't put much of that in my blog. I'll leave you with the JCI Creed.</p>
<p><em>We believe</em></p>
<p><em>That faith in god gives meaning and purpose to human life,</em></p>
<p><em>That the brotherhood of man transcends the sovereignty of nations,</em></p>
<p><em>That economic justice can best be won by free men through free enterprise,</em></p>
<p><em>That government should be of laws rather than of men,</em></p>
<p><em>That earth's great treasure lies in human personality,</em></p>
<p><em>And that service to humanity is the best work of life.</em></p>
